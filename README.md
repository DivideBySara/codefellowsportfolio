See this website live at [CodeFellowsWebApp](https://codefellowswebapp.herokuapp.com/).

My Microsoft via Apprenti apprenticeship training begins with Code Fellows 301.
This is my class portfolio project I started from scratch.

Special thanks to [Stephanie Lingwood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanielingwood/) for teaching Code Fellows 301 and all of the fun skills that went into this website. Thanks also to [Brian McFarlane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-mcfarlane-462552a3/) for assistance tweaking the UI, [Don Pham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-pham-b57457a0/), [David](https://github.com/squeekyfoot/portfolio), and [Britini Malloy](https://github.com/britinimalloy) for resolving issues, and [Tracey Radcliffe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracey-radcliffe/) for code reviews.
